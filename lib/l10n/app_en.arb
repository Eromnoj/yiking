  "yijingExplanationTitle": "What is the Yi Jing?",
  "yijingExplanationContent": "The Yi Jing (or Yi-king), also known as the 'Book of Changes,' is an ancient Chinese text of divination and philosophical wisdom. It is considered one of the oldest and most important texts of ancient China, dating back over 2500 years.\n\nThe Yi Jing consists of 64 hexagrams, which are combinations of six continuous and broken lines. Each hexagram represents a specific state or situation, and the individual lines can be interpreted as 'Yin' or 'Yang' lines, generating different combinations.\n\nThe application allows you to simulate a draw with coins but also allows you to manually enter a draw.",
  "yijingHowToTitle": "How to Draw the Yi Jing with Coins?",
  "yijingHowToContent": "To perform a Yi Jing draw with coins, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Take three identical coins, such as coins.\n2. Assign a numerical value to each coin: for example, consider 'heads' and 'tails' as 2 and 3, respectively.\n3. Formulate a clear and precise question in your mind and note it down, for which you want to receive guidance or information.\n4. Hold the three coins in your hand and shake them.\n5. Toss the coins in front of you and note the results. For example, if the three coins show 'heads,' 'heads,' and 'tails,' you would get the values 2, 2, and 3, respectively.\n6. Convert the obtained results into a line of the Yi Jing hexagram. For this, you can use the following correspondence:\n\n • If you obtain a 6, the line will be a mutating Yin line (a broken line with a center cross to mark the mutation).\n• If you obtain a 7, the line will be a nascent Yang line (a continuous line).\n• If you obtain an 8, the line will be a nascent Yin line (a broken line).\n• If you obtain a 9, the line will be a mutating Yang line (a continuous line with a center circle to mark the mutation).\n\n7. Repeat the steps to obtain a total of six lines, from bottom to top.\n8. You will then have a complete hexagram.\n9. Once the result is entered into the application, you will get the judgment of the hexagram, as well as an indication for interpretation.",
  "yijingNoteTitle": "Notes",
  "yijingNoteContent": "The Yi Jing is a tool for decision-making, and the interpretation may depend on your state of mind and the situation you are in. It is sometimes necessary to revisit the result of a draw as the situation evolves, to align your decisions based on new insights. Your draws are saved in the application for easy retrieval when needed.\n\nIt is important to note that understanding and interpreting the Yi Jing can be complex. If you are a beginner, it may be helpful to consult additional resources or seek guidance from an experienced Yi Jing practitioner for more accurate interpretation.\n\nThe texts of the hexagrams are based on the French translation from Chinese by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre (1838-1902) in the public domain. The interpretations are based on research from various Yi Jing reference books.",
